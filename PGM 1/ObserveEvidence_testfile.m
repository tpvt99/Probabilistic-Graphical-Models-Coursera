% ObserveEvidence Modify a vector of factors given some evidence.
%   F = ObserveEvidence(F, E) sets all entries in the vector of factors, F,
%   that are not consistent with the evidence, E, to zero. F is a vector of
%   factors, each a data structure with the following fields:
%     .var    Vector of variables in the factor, e.g. [1 2 3]
%     .card   Vector of cardinalities corresponding to .var, e.g. [2 2 2]
%     .val    Value table of size prod(.card)
%   E is an N-by-2 matrix, where each row consists of a variable/value pair. 
%     Variables are in the first column and values are in the second column.
% FACTORS.INPUT(1) contains P(X_1)
